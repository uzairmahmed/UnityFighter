*Project Brief:*
December 21, 2017

The game consists of a player, with the objective to fight oncoming waves and survive as long as
possible. The player will be armed with a sword, and can move around, and attack. It will have a set
health limit, and energy limit. Health is lost as the player gets attacked, and regenerates based on the
energy level. The energy is lost overtime, and can be gained through killing attackers.
Depending on time-constraints, the game might have functionality to upgrade the sword as the
game progresses. The attackers consist of two (or three different classes – Crawler, Runner, and
Walker), and (based on time-constraints) will get harder and harder as the game progresses.
Specifically, the game needs functionality for a human controlled player, functionality for AI
controlled attackers (will use and abstract class for base type), a UI with the health and energy tracking
variables.
